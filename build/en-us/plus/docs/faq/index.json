We’ve got information on what\n  you would find useful and what you would be interested in. All the premium\n  features we propose today reflect that feedback. MDN Plus is an initial step\n  towards making the experience on the site more interactive and helpful for our\n  users.\n</p>","<h2 id=\"how-much-does-mdn-plus-cost-\">How much does MDN Plus cost?</h2>\n<p>\n  A three-tiered pricing model has been put in place in order to try and\n  accommodate our users’ needs as much as possible:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <em>MDN Core</em> - A free plan, for those ones who want to try out a limited version\n    of the premium features.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>MDN Plus 5</em> - A $5/month or $50/year plan that offers unlimited access to the\n    premium features included in MDN Plus.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <em>MDN Supporter 10</em> - A $10/month or $100/year plan for users who want to\n    support MDN with a higher amount. On top of the MDN Plus premium features, MDN\n    supporters will be able to contribute and shape the product moving forward, by\n    having early access to premium features and a direct feedback channel with the\n    MDN team.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Subscribing for a yearly plan activates a 20% discount for all the paid options.</p>","<h2 id=\"can-i-upgrade/downgrade-my-plan-\">Can I upgrade/downgrade my plan?</h2>\n<p>\n  Currently, you can only upgrade your plan. For getting a downgrade, please\n  cancel your current subscription first and then activate the new one.\n</p>","<h2 id=\"what-is-happening-with-the-existing-mdn-web-docs-\">What is happening with the existing MDN Web Docs?</h2>\n<p>\n  Nothing. We will continue to develop &amp; maintain our web documentation that will\n  remain free and accessible for everyone. There will be no change there. Even\n  more, we believe that MDN Web Docs will benefit from MDN Plus, as we plan to\n  reinvest part of the gains from MDN Plus and improve our documentation as well\n  as the overall user experience on the website.\n</p>","<h2 id=\"are-we-violating-any-os-license-obligation-by-adding-a-paid-product-to-mdn-\">Are we violating any OS license obligation by adding a paid product to MDN?</h2>\n<p>\n  MDN content is made available under a CC BY-SA 2.5 license. That license doesn't\n  preclude Mozilla (or other users of MDN content) from having a paid product. MDN\n  Plus adds premium features like notifications and collections on top of the free\n  content. Regular users can still access and reuse MDN content under the Creative\n  Commons license.\n</p>","<h2 id=\"where-will-the-money-from-mdn-plus-go-\">Where will the money from MDN Plus go?</h2>\n<p>\n  Since its beginning in 2005, MDN Web Docs has been a project hosted and provided\n  by Mozilla. Mozilla covers the cost of infrastructure, development and\n  maintenance of the MDN platform, including a team of engineers and its own team\n  of dedicated writers.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Mozilla wants MDN Plus to help ensure that MDN's open source content continues\n  to be supported into the future. MDN Plus has been built only with Mozilla\n  resources, and any revenue generated by MDN Plus will stay within Mozilla. We\n  are looking into ways to reinvest some of these additional funds into open\n  source projects contributing to MDN but it is still in the early stages.\n</p>","<h2 id=\"does-the-launch-of-mdn-plus-impact-the-relationship-with-partners-like-owd-\">Does the launch of MDN Plus impact the relationship with partners like OWD?</h2>\n<p>\n  The existence of a new subscription model will not detract from MDN's current\n  free Web Docs offering in any way. The current experience of accessing web\n  documentation will not change for users who do not wish to sign up for a premium\n  subscription. Open Web Docs (OWD) and Mozilla will continue to work closely\n  together on MDN for the best possible web platform documentation for everyone.\n  For more information about how our organizations work together, please check\n  <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2022/03/mozilla-and-open-web-docs-working-together-on-mdn/\">this article</a>.\n</p>","<h2 id=\"what-regions-is-mdn-plus-available-in-\">What regions is MDN Plus available in?</h2>\n<p>\n  The free version of MDN Plus is available worldwide.
